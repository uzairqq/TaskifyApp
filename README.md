# TaskifyApp-Archive 🗄️ (Archived)

> **Status:** Archived / experiments repo  
> **Purpose:** This repository contains old iterations, spikes, and structure experiments for my Taskify project.  
> ✅ The **active, job-ready** version lives here: **Taskify (main repo)** 

---

## Why this repo exists
During learning and exploration, I repeatedly created and removed different project structures (Clean Architecture, layering, EF setup variants, etc.).  
To keep my portfolio clean and recruiter-friendly, I moved all experiments here and started a fresh repo for the final version.

---

## What you’ll find inside
- Multiple iterations of backend structure (folders/layers may change across commits)
- EF Core setup experiments (PostgreSQL / packages / infrastructure attempts)
- Temporary scaffolding and refactors
- Work-in-progress code that is **not guaranteed to run**

---

## Important notes
- ❌ **Not maintained**
- ❌ **Not production-ready**
- ❌ **May not compile/run on latest changes**
- ✅ Kept only for **learning history** and **reference**

---

## How to use (if you want to explore)
1. Browse commits to see how I evolved the structure
2. If you want to run anything, pick a stable commit and checkout:
   ```bash
   git checkout <commit-hash>
